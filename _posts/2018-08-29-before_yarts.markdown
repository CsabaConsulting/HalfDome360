description: Hitchhike at the Visitor Center before I bailed to YARTS
---
After I got back to the Visitor Center I learned that you simply wait for the YARTS and buy tickets from the driver. I ran down to the nearby road to try to hitchhike once more before YARTS arrived.
After the bus stopped I ran back and purchased my ticket. It really took until 3:15 PM to reach Fresno. I requested North Fresno drop-off (that's drop-off only) and that's near the Kaiser Hospital.
That wasn't so far from the Sportsman store where my car was standing for 2 days now, normally I'd walk that mile but this time I got an Uber for $6. Soon I was home to make it to the Data Science Bootcamp.
