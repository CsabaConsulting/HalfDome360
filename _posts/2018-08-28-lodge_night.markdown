I realized only later how lucky I was that there was one vacant room at the Lodge. Although it's really pricey ($314) and the room doesn't have an AC and was kinda hot, I still had a bed to sleep.
I was beyond tired of any tiredness level. I set the fan high and only used the sheet as the blanket. Now I had a wifi but it still was so flaky (the phone was in an endless loop to drop and reconnect to the hotspot) that it was unusable.
I had a night of sleep though.
