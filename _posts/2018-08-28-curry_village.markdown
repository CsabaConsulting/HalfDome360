description: Parking at Curry Village

Although being a workday Wednesday, the Yosemite Valley Trailhead Parking (on the Happy Isle Loop) became just full, so we backtracked and parked on the roadside near Curry Village (about 0.4 miles from the trailhead).
I was wainly wearing a [Nathan VaporKrar](https://www.fleetfeet.com/products/nathan-vaporkrar-4l-race-vest) with front bottles, a vintage mountain biker 3L bladder camlbak (Red Sun brand, a race prize back from Hungary 12+ years ago), and as always a fanny pack.
Later for the final attack I picked up my [Mountainsmith Day TLS lumbar pack](https://www.rei.com/product/829858/mountainsmith-day-tls-waistpack) which I used two years ago when my twin brother Attila and me smashed the 4 mile trail to Glacier Point and back on the Panorama Trail and the Mist Trail to the valley floor.
Overall later I filled the 3 big waterbottles in the lumbar pack at the faucets at the bridge and that came about 2 gallons of water capacity with all the encumberance of that. Next time I'm researching water purifier methods to be able to climb light.
For shoes I was wearing a long discontinued [Hoka One One Mafate Speed](https://www.rei.com/product/873196/hoka-one-one-mafate-speed-trail-running-shoes-mens) with a SOLE insole. I hoarded several of these pairs, because newer flyknit and seamless constructs often not tall enough in the toebox for my giant bigtoes.
(my bigtoes' size is not seem to be that alarming on [Fleet Feet's Volumental 3D feet scan](https://my.volumental.com/en/fleet_feet/f645d0c6-39bc-422c-90f5-4386c525cba6/), but believe me that it looks like if Thor would smashed it with his hammer and it swole up, but that's how it is normally).
