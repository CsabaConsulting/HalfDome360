description: Hitchhike at Camp 4 near Yosemite Falls trailhead

A nice ranger at the Visitor Center gave me cardboard and some sharpies so I could construct my Fresno sign.
She advised Camp 4, which I could reach both with the regular and the El Capitan shuttles and it's very close to the Yosemite Falls trailhead. The spot is as west as I can be without having a mode of shuttle transportationi back to other stops.
Maybe the fact that it was morning or the selected spot wasn't perfect but noone stopped for Fresno. I had two samaritans, one would brought me to the tunnel and the other to Oakhurst. I didn't have enough courage to make the leap of faith, I was not sure if I'm not succesful here if anyone would pick me up at the tunnel or Oakhurst.
Of course this is all knowing that I had the fallback YARTS ride ($15) from the Visitor Center. So at around 10:30 am I cought the El Cap shuttle (that has way less stops until the visitor center and made it bakc to the center around 10:45am.
