When I booked the room the previous night I learned that the first YARTS bus was only about to leave at 11:15 am and would get back to Fresno around 3:20 pm (8 stops).
I planned to have a breakfast in the Food Court and then hitchhike because that drive should not take much more than 1.5 hours, I wanted to be home before noon.
